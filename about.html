I was born in Northern India and then at the age of two, moved to Switerland where I lived for seven years. 
    In 2007 I moved to Rhode Island with my family. Since moving to the United States, I have danced for 7 years to a
    classical indian dance form called Bharatanatyam. I finished dancing in 2017, after a four and a half hour long performance. 
    I received a Bachelor's in Business Management and International Business in 2021 at Goucher College in
    Baltimore, Maryland. I then took a few years from academia, and worked in the business field. In the fall of
    2023, I volunteered for 12 weeks in South Africa in nature conservation and animal preservation. 
    This fall of 2024, I have decided to go back to school at the University of Rhode Island for a BA and Masters in Computer Science, as well as  
    a Masters in Psychology.
