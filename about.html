I was born in Northern India and then at the age of two, moved to Switerland where I lived for seven years. 
    In 2007 I moved to Rhode Island with my family. Since moving to the United States, I have danced for 7 years to a
    classical indian dance form called Bharatanatyam. I finished dancing in 2017, after a four and a half hour long performance. 
    I received a Bachelor's in Business Management and International Business in 2021 at Goucher College in
    Baltimore, Maryland. I then took a few years from academia, and worked in the business field. In the fall of
    2023, I volunteered for 12 weeks in South Africa in nature conservation and animal preservation. 
    This fall of 2024, I have decided to go back to school at the University of Rhode Island for a BA and Masters in Computer Science, as well as  
    a Masters in Psychology.

  My all time favorite thing to do is travel. I have been asked many times, "what is your favorite place to travel?" 
  Something about it is really hard to answer. I have been traveling since the age of two, and what I love most about it are three things: 1.) the plane ride, 2.) 
  the new architecture, landscape, art and culture, 3.) the people and the language. Like my father, my sister and I inherited the love
  of learning languages. I love meeting new people and learning more about what the world has to offer. Even when I spend
  weeks in a place, I am always up for another adventure. I don't think its ever possible to go to a country once and then believe one has
   "been there, done that" type of thing and never returns. It's like re-watching a show or movie for another time, details missed the first time around,
   are then caught and sometimes even more appreciated. Humans are ever evolving and so do countries, the ways you might remember something is completely differeent
   many years later.
    </p>

   <p>
    With all that being said, if I had to choose a favorite country, it would be at this given moment in 2024, South Africa. Why you may ask, because ever since I was really little, I have always wanted to go there. 
    Something, about the wildlife fascinates me. The complexity of the animal kingdom and the way in which each animal is created to the very last detail, is just incredible. I don't think anything was ever left out. Elephants have the most impressive memories 
    and are so wise. Lions are so majestic and powerful. To have a lion stare at you with such intensity is breathtaking. Leopards are really hard to spot (pun intended). They blend in immacutlately  with the high grass, and only movement indicates their presence. 
    Being in South Africa for three months was just a lifetime experience.

Many species of animals are dying every day. A lot of animals are endagered or on the brink of exintction due to loss of habitat, poaching, and climate change.
Climate change is causing the ice glaciers to melt, severe droughts, severe floods, and widespread across acres of forest; forest fires.  
The Western Black Rhino and the Northern White Rhino are officially exinct.
