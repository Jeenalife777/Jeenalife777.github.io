  <h1> Ways We Communicate With One Another</h1>  

<p> 
  Communication is essential in maintaining healthy relationships. It builds trust,
  honesty, and connection. Whether it's improving a relationship with your mother, or your friends or
  even in your love life. Nothing is <em> sexier</em> than good communucation. 
<br>
<br>
</p>
<p> 
There are key elements as you move forward with healthier communication. All animals,
including ourselves, communicate in mutilple ways: <em> sound</em> what we say, and how we say it and then <em> physical cues </em> your body posture, body odor and facial expressions. 
Have you ever spoken to someone and they say something but their body language communicates the complete 
opposite? Inflection of tone and the way the body is posed will communicate a lot. 
Tone inflections determine a person's mood, what they are expressing and how. Body language indicates a person's interest,
whether they are open or closed, and how engaged they are. 

</p>

<p> Examples Where Sound and Physical Cues are In Sync: <ul> 
  <li> Romantically interested: Pointing their toes towards you and legs touching, and flirting 
    <br>
  <li> Engaged: Leaning forward, and resting their arms on the desk, nodding their head and asking questions. 
    <br>
<li> Closed Off: Arms folded across the body, getting defensive, and pulling away. 
  <br>
<li> Nervous: Rubbing their hands through their hair, worried expression, pacing back and fourth, smelling stronger, and stuttering. 
  <br>
</li> 
  
  </ul>

</p>

<P> Examples of Not in Sync: 
  <ul> 
<li> Romantically interested?: Not touching, toes pointed away and flirting. 
  <br>
<li> Engaged? Slumping forward, resting their arm on their chin, nodding their head, asking questions. 
  <br>
<li> Closed Off? Arms crossed, calm voice, inflected tone. <br>
 <li> Nervous? Smells stronger, sitting, and calm expression. 

</li>

  </ul>

  <p> There are ways in which body or tone tells a different story than what you are saying or doing. Unconciously we convey these messages without even knowing it.  </p>
