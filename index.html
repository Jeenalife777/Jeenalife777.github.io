<h1>How Technology has Changed People</h1>
<p> As society has advanced their technology, communication has changed drastically. 
    What was a letter received weeks later after it was written, 
    to a telegram sent every few months, and then eventually a phone call once in while
    All that has led to the advancement of the phones, which grew to the first computer, 
    then the ipod, then the smartphone, the apple watch and so much more.
<br>
<br>
</p>Technology had changed people in two ways. The first one being people 
    believing that they are entitled to having access to someone 24/7, and that it should be 
    considered a normal behavior. Secondly, technology has given people the perception
    that what they say online does not matter, but <em> it does!</em> </p> Things written
    online do not ever go away, it is <strong> <em>PERMANENT</em> </strong> and it is 
    there for the <em> EVERYONE</em> to see. 
    Your mother's friends' cousin five times removed can see it, your aunt in Australia,
    your little sibling who looks up to you can see it, just anyone you could possibly know and those who you don't, 
    one being also your future <em>boss!</em>
    There are so many popular phrases to use but the two I will use today are <em> "Think Before You Act"</em> and the other is 
    <em> "If You Do Not Have Anything Nice to Say, Don't Say It At All." </em>
<br>
<br> 
</p>
<p> We are in this weird period where people assume someone is always available and 
    saying whatever one wants is deemed acceptable. Extremely serious conversations like
    not loving someone anymore is done through text, or extremely heated arguments,
    or texting after work hours at 3:30 am in the morning. Do people not deserve 
    a respect for boundaries, and in person conversations? Just because technology 
    has progressed in the art of communicating with one another, doesn't mean that <em> basic</em>
    human values of treating someone kindly and respectully needs to be gotten rid of. 
    So remember the <em>next time</em> you write something on instagram after being triggered, 
    or when you want to make plans to meet, <em> be mindful and respectful!</em>
