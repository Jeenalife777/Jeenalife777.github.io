<h1> Classification of Big Cats: </h1>

  <img id="bigCatC" src="images/big-cats-bio-classifcation-chart.png" alt="Big Cat Classification" title="Big Cat Classification" height="400px">
  
What is considered a Big Cat? What classifies them that way? <br>
It all has to do with the scientific classification of the genetic makeup of each, and what attributes are similiar to one another which can be cateogrized such as: diet, physical features, communication style, and geographical location. 
All are under the <em>Kingdom </em> <strong> <em> Animalia</em> </strong> (animal), then their <em> Class </em>is <strong> <em>Mamalia </em> </strong> (mammal), and <em> Order</em> is <strong> <em>Carnivora</em> </strong>  (carnivore) due to their diet. 
From there we then see they are all in the <em> Family </em> of<strong> <em> Felidae </em> </strong> (feline [cat]), which then branches into the cateogry known as <em> Genus </em> of <strong> <em> Panthera </em> </strong> and <strong> <em> Felinae. </em> </strong> 
The Big Cats are considered the following from the panthera line: the lion, the tiger, the jaguar, the leopard, and the snow leaopard and from the Felidae line: the cheetah and cougar. As we learn more about these majestic creatures, some classifications aren't entirely accurate as more studies have led to a better understanding;
 such as the misconception that all Big Cats roar and all small cats purr. <br> <br>

<p> We are in this weird period where people assume someone is always available and 
    saying whatever one wants is deemed acceptable. Extremely serious conversations like
    not loving someone anymore is done through text, or extremely heated arguments,
    or texting after work hours at 3:30 am in the morning. Do people not deserve 
    a respect for boundaries, and in person conversations? Just because technology 
    has progressed in the art of communicating with one another, doesn't mean that <em> basic</em>
    human values of treating someone kindly and respectully needs to be gotten rid of. 
    So remember the <em>next time</em> you write something on instagram after being triggered, 
    or when you want to make plans to meet, <em> be mindful and respectful!</em>
